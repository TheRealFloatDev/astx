# astx (Abstract Syntax Tree Executable)
A **very early** stage project to compile and run JavaScript to an AST-based binary format.

The goal is to drastically reduce the size of JS files by compiling them to a binary format.
This is not a replacement for minification or obfuscation, but because of its binary format it is harder to reverse engineer similar to other compiled languages.

ASTX is a binary format that represents an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a JavaScript program.
The AST is serialized to a binary format that can be executed from within **any** JavaScript runtime using this library.
That means that every JavaScript program can be compiled to an ASTX binary file and executed by the ASTX runtime library from within a JavaScript environment.

This project is inspired by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), but it is not meant to be a replacement for it.

## This project has moved!!
This project is now maintained by [Garmingo](https://github.com/Garmingo) and has moved to [https://github.com/Garmingo/astx](https://github.com/Garmingo/astx)

## Benefits of working with an AST-based binary format
- **Size**: The binary format is smaller than the original JavaScript source code.
- **Feature support**: Since we are working on the JavaScript AST, we can support all JavaScript features. (Some features **might** not be fully supported yet)
- **Performance**: The ASTX runtime can optimize the execution of the program.
- **Security**: The binary format is harder to reverse engineer than the original JavaScript source code.
- **Optimization**: The ASTX compiler has *theoretically* all the benefits of a compiler, like optimizations and dead code elimination.
- **Runtime Independence**: The ASTX runtime can theoretically be implemented in any language, not just JavaScript (although **this** implementation is in JavaScript).

## Installation
```bash
npm install @astx/lib
```

## Usage

### Compiling
```javascript
import { compile, saveToFile } from '@astx/lib';

const program = compile(`
  function main() {
    return 1 + 2;
  }
`);

saveToFile(program, 'program.astx');
```

### Running
```javascript
import { loadFromFile, run } from '@astx/lib';

const program = loadFromFile('program.astx');
const result = run(program); 
// or
run(program)
```

## Known limitations
- **working directory**: The working directory of the ASTX runtime is the working directory of the execution environment, meaning that **require** and **import** statements will be relative to the working directory of the execution environment and **NOT** the working directory of the .astx file.
- **Transformer side-effects**: Since we are now basically are doing AOT (Ahead Of Time) compilation, we can run transformers to improve the code. These transformers can have side-effects (if they are faulty) that can change the behavior of the program. This is not a limitation per se, but it is something to be aware of.
